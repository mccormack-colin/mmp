        <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
          <p>Congratulations on your pregnancy and soon or recent birth of your child! I’m so excited and happy you've decided that you want to have a professional capture the first few days of your new baby's life in art form. You will want to contact me preferably prior to the birth of your baby. We will speak before your session and I will ask you to provide me with some information about you, your family, and your new bundle of joy so that I can customize this once in a life time experience.</p>
          <p>Clear exception and communication are key for a successful session. I hope to prepare you with the following information so you feel relaxed with me as your photographer and so you are excited for your session. This is a lot of information, so please don’t hesitate to ask questions.</p>
          <p>There is a lot of prep work that goes on before a session in the studio and some tips to follow for you and your baby. We both need to be ready for a successful session. The information below has come together from my experience in the studio, my mentors’ advice and having two of my own babies (including a colicky baby that spent 3 weeks in the NICU!). This time in your life is a very unfamiliar, bumpy, scary, amazingly beautiful journey. Anyone who has had a child (especially, first time parents) has been there. I am so thankful to the NICU nurses that taught be so much in the 3 weeks I spent with them about how to take care of babies. I couldn’t imagine going straight home without their support and knowledge. Hopefully, some of these tips will help to make your session (and maybe even those first few weeks) easier!</p>
          <h3>Baby is here!</h3>
          <p>You've brought a beautiful, new, little life into the world and boy, what a life changing experience that was! Once, you’ve caught your breath and you realize there is actually a lot of downtime/snuggling, you'll need to have someone contact me via email or by phone (preferably within the first 48 hours) to touch base and discuss options for booking your session. How and when you end up giving birth will determine how long you and your baby's stay will be in the hospital. As long as everyone is happy and healthy (always what we hope for) a natural birth is usually a 48 hour stay and a C-section is usually 4 day stay. I prefer to book newborn sessions on the 6th-10th days of life. By this time you’ve had a few days at home figuring out how to live like a zombie with your bundle of no-sleeping, constantly pooping and eating love of your life! If you are breastfeeding, the first several days are a transition from colostrum to breastmilk which means constant nursing and long days for mom and baby. Usually, at 6-10 days, your milk has come in, and the insanity has become slightly less insane. Once your baby is older than 10 days, he/she will be awake a little more often and less curled in that fetal pose. This is just the general rule, some babies are great eaters/sleepers from the beginning and some fight it all (I’ve had one of each). Below are some key steps to follow the day of your session to help your baby sleep so I can work my magic!</p>
          <h3>The Day of your Session:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Please bathe your newborn an hour or two before your session. A warm 10 minute bath should wake him/her up and get baby squeaky clean for his/her modeling debut! Don't worry if  your baby has flaky skin, bring lotion with you to use before the session.</li>
            <li>Hold off feeding time until RIGHT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FOR your session. Feeding your baby before you leave will allow a relaxed feeding in your own home (especially if you are still mastering breastfeeding together). Note that a full feed can take 30-45 minutes, so don’t rush. It’s important that the baby is full. Once you have finished your feeding please put baby in the car seat in as LITTLE clothing as possible (diaper only, snap together shirt or onsie) and cover in a blanket (weather permitting). This allows your baby to enjoy the ride over to the studio and arrive in a deep sleep. If little to no clothing is being worn, I am able to start the session as soon as you arrive if baby is happy and asleep. If you are breastfeeding, please consider expressing/pumping a bottle of milk and bringing it with you so that we can quickly get baby full and happy in between set ups. If you have never bottle fed your baby this one time bottle feeding will get them what is called "milk drunk" because they will get lots of milk, very quickly, without much effort. This one time optional feeding should not cause nipple confusion. I know some moms (including me!) have a hard time expressing milk, so if you choose not to bottle feed (completely OKAY) then I will ask that you breastfeed, you may need to do it several times during the session. If you are feeding formula or bottle feeding breastmilk please bring at least 8oz of extra food. I know that sounds like a lot, but modeling is super hard work and babies tend to work up an appetite looking so adorable! The idea behind this VERY IMPORTANT step is to exhaust our little model, stuff them like a thanksgiving turkey, and allow them to drift off into a deep, deep sleep that we only dream of!</li>
            <li>Please bring a pacifier, even if you are not using it yet. The pacifier will help soothe your baby into positions, if needed. Some of my clients have told me their doctors have told them to not use a pacifier while breastfeeding, you do not need to use it after your session. During a 2-3 hour session, for a few moments here and there, using a pacifier will not cause an issue. Again, it is OKAY if you choose not to use a pacifier. My babies always refused one so I completely understand if it doesn't work. It's just a tool in our toolbox. I have read about some new studies show that using a pacifier can actually help to build the muscles in the jaw to assist in sucking while breastfeeding. Learn more <a href="http://www.today.com/moms/no-more-nipple-confusion-study-says-pacifiers-may-help-breast-743227">HERE</a></li>
            <li>Please bring plenty of diapers, wipes, and blankets to wrap your baby in. While in between poses I will loosely place a diaper on your baby to protect you and have you wrap them in a nice warm blanket.</li>
            <li>Please bring PLENTY of liquids for yourself to drink and a snack. The room gets very warm (about 85-90 degrees) so it is important that you stay hydrated, especially if you are breastfeeding. Electrolyte drinks (coconut water, electrolyte water) are great  to drink while breastfeeding, the electrolytes help in the production of milk. If you aren't producing lots of milk in the beginning, try eating a bowl of oatmeal and check out these <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/oatmeal-chocolate-chip-lactation-cookies-by-noel-trujillo-192346">Lactation Cookies</a> you can make! </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>The In's and Out's of each session:</h3>
          <p>Each newborn session typically averages between 2-3 hours and are booked for 3 hours. Please allot for 3 hours. This is extremely important as we operate on baby’s time so patience is very important for  all of us, as the photographer and Mom & Dad! Poses take time to perfect (yes, I’m a perfectionist) and sometimes baby will fuss a little before relaxing into the pose I put them in. Please know that I will never put baby in danger or allow fussing to become anything more than that. Someone will be right with baby at all times. Sometimes I have an assistant who helps me, but if she is not available then I may ask you to assist me with a hand, finger or just stand next to baby while I step away to grab a prop. For most of the session I want you to relax and enjoy the silence, the break, the heat (haha), and your baby in the sweetest poses.</p>
          <p>Baby is tastefully nude in many of the photographs (which is why the studio is so warm), swaddled, or in cute outfits including hats,bonnets, rompers, etc provided by me. Baby is kept warm by several space heaters, blankets and soothed by a noise machine. The studio room does get pretty warm as previously noted (about 80 degrees) so don't forget water to keep yourself cool and hydrated! Because baby is nude most of the time, there is a very high chance something or someone will get soiled. It happens all the time and I have been christened by tons of babies, it's just part of the job! Linens and I are cleaned prior to each session. I do try to keep the diaper on loosely in between shots and when moving baby around for Mom and Dad's protection, but I can't guarantee you won't be soiled on if you're in a pose with baby! It’s not a bad idea to bring a change of clothes for yourself.</p>
          <p>I love to have both parents and any other children attend the session to create portraits of the entire family. If you have a young child then the session starts with your young child(ren) and if Dad wants to be photographed with baby. Once that has been done I ask that arrangements be made to have Dad leave with the young child(ren). Driving separate cars works best in this scenario. If that is not an option, that's okay! Please be sure to bring plenty of activities for your other child to do quietly, lots of snacks, and juice.</p>
          <p>Mom doesn't have to show up all dolled up, bring your makeup bag and get ready while I pose baby. Or take it easy and ask me about getting a hair and make up artist. Once you’re ready, we will take your photos with your sweet pea. You do not have to be in photographs, but I always encourage it, if not for yourself, then for your baby who will love too see what mom was like. Be sure to dress according to studio weather (not the weather outside!) remember it will be almost 80 in the studio, so a sweater is not the best choice without optional layers to remove!</p>
          <p>Baby spends the majority of the session asleep on a giant beanbag, in props, or wrapped up tight. Then, baby is posed with Mom/Dad against a background that fits the color scheme in your home *the order will be slightly different if siblings are being photographed*. Finally, baby will be placed inside baskets, buckets and other props against backgrounds based on prior discussions.</p>
          <p>That's it, the session is over. It was a very warm, sweaty, beautiful experience for all of us. You pack baby up and head home to relax. Believe it or not your little model will most likely be starving and exhausted, which, hopefully, means nap time for everyone!</p>
          <p>Now the real work for me begins, which is hard to believe after watching me do yoga and sweat with your newborn for 2-3 hours. Now comes the editing. Although I use studio lighting and an expensive camera, there is still more work to be done. Scratches, blemishes, skin tone and doing special editing like composites takes time. I tend to spend about 3-6 hours editing your newborn session over about 2-4 weeks. </p>
          <p>Safety is very important to me. I make sure that in each session my babies are safe in each pose. If that means more post work to get that shot and have baby be safe then I'm all for it! Hands are on or next to baby at all times!</p>
          <h3>The Reason to Invest!</h3>
          <p>The investment of photography is worth every penny. Your baby, that tiny squishy love, that you carried in your body for 9 months, will so, so quickly be rolling, coo-ing, smiling, crawling, clapping, walking, talking, and stealing your heart with each new and amazing day. Newborns aren't newborns for long. Savor it forever by displaying your newborn portraits on your wall or in an album so you can revisit and share this once in a life time memory over and over. </p>
